You are a world-class senior frontend engineer + creative designer. 
Build me the **world’s best portfolio website** that feels professional, modern, and recruiter-attracting. 
The site must showcase senior-level animations, transitions, and unique features that stand out.  

Requirements:
- Tech Stack: React + Next.js (latest) + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for animations + shadcn/ui components.
- Design: Minimal, elegant, glassmorphism + subtle gradients + soft shadows. 
  Must look professional and high-end (like a senior designer/engineer’s portfolio). 
- Layout: 
  • Hero section with my name, role (Frontend + AI Engineer), and dynamic text animation.  
  • Smooth scrolling, parallax backgrounds, section reveals on scroll, hover animations.  
  • About section with animated timeline of education + experience.  
  • Projects showcase with interactive cards (3D tilt, hover animations, expandable modal with details).  
  • Skills cloud (tags animate & float dynamically).  
  • Resume download button with glowing hover animation.  
  • Testimonials / achievements carousel with auto-rotation + manual controls.  
  • Contact form (email + socials) with success/failure toast.  
  • Sticky navbar with smooth scroll + active section highlight.  
- Animations: 
  • Framer Motion page transitions.  
  • Parallax hero background with subtle floating elements.  
  • 3D project cards (react-tilt or custom).  
  • Scroll-triggered reveal animations.  
  • Neon/glass hover effects.  
- Features:
  • Light/dark mode toggle with smooth transition.  
  • Mobile-first, fully responsive.  
  • SEO optimized (Next.js head metadata, open graph).  
  • Performance-optimized (lazy load images, code-splitting).  
  • Contact form integration with free email API (Resend, EmailJS, or Nodemailer).  
- Deliverables:
  • Full Next.js app with all code (pages, components, styles).  
  • Clear folder structure (components/, pages/, styles/, lib/).  
  • Deployment-ready (Vercel).  
  • README with setup + deployment instructions.  
  • Example placeholder data for projects, skills, and testimonials.  

Goal:  
Make it so attractive that recruiters and peers instantly get a **wow effect** — clean, innovative, and professional.  
The portfolio should feel like it belongs to a **senior-level engineer + designer**.  

Now generate the complete project with:  
1. Repository tree  
2. All key files (pages, components, styles, animations) with **working code** (not placeholders).  
3. Demo content (projects, skills, testimonials) I can replace easily.  
4. Tailwind + Framer Motion animations implemented cleanly.  
5. Instructions to run locally and deploy to Vercel.
